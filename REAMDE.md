# Spring Data Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Spring Data Learning Journey** repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress and showcasing projects as I explore the powerful tools and techniques of Spring Data. 🌟

## 📚 What I'm Learning
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Mastering database interaction using raw SQL and prepared statements.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Learning to map Java objects to database tables using annotations and entity classes.
- **Hibernate**: Understanding ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) concepts, lazy loading, caching, and query optimization.
- **Spring Data**: Simplifying data access layers with Spring's abstraction over JPA and JDBC.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Java 17**: The language powering the development.
- **MySQL**: The database used for learning and experimentation.
- **Spring Framework**: A versatile framework providing dependency injection and data management.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tools.
